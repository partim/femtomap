# _femtomap_ â€“ A map rendering library in Rust

Femtomap is a work-in-progress library for rendering maps. It will provide
the means to describe the content of a map and draw it onto a surface.

It is based on the renderer tailor-written for the
[Railway History Map](https://map.railwayhistory.org/) and will allow
drawing very complex maps created both from a manual description of the
content as well as from processed GIS data.
